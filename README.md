# What?

This is Raspberry Pi image that outputs a 1080p 60fps signal, playing back [Big Buck Bunny](https://peach.blender.org/) on a continous loop.

# Why?

I do a lot of video processing/encoding. Instead of requiring actual cameras and aiming it at a TV, I use a Rasperry Pi to produce a feed with constant/clear motion with beautiful colors.
